This is an evolving package for working with Reduced Ordered Binary Decision
Diagrams. Details of the data structure can be found at:

Plan of action:
Sequential operations phase:
 - Begin with simple BDD operations. [COMPLETE]
 - Implement BDD --> ROBDD conversion, update operations to use this conversion
   resulting in ROBDDs. [IN PROGRESS]
 - Add helpers to measure operations cost in various terms:
   - Total number of nodes at the end of the operation
   - Maximum number of nodes during the operation
   - Time taken per operation
 - Implement direct ROBDD construction and optimized ROBDD --> ROBDD operations,
 - Add comparison tests, fuzz tests for the two implementations so far.
 - Implement concurrent implementations for these operations, and add comparison
   tests.
